/** Stuff about Lambda Calculus */

/** 
    Lambda Calculus created by: Alonzo Church
    A Mathmatical model for computation that involves a lot of 
    functions and recursion

    * Turing's invention of the Turing Machine and Alonzo Church's invention
    * of the Lambda Calculus happened at a very similar time
    * --> Turing then added an addendum to his paper stating that these two 
    * --> methods of computation are equivilent.
