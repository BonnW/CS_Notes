// I.E. take some input and gives some output


/**
 *  Big O' is a Measure of runtime Efficiency 
 *  Asymptotic = Assuming You keep throwing data at it, what happens
 *  Don't care about constants 
 *  Care about the things that you run that grow as you throw more 
 *  input at your program.
